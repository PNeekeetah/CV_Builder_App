# CV_Builder_App
The idea behind this project is to create a simple wizard that guides the user through the steps of creating a CV. The reason why I am building this is that I like how CVs built using LaTeX look like, but I am aware that most people would rather use Word or Libre office to build their CVs rather than learning something such as LaTeX.
